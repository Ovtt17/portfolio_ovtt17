        I specialize in back-end development with Java and Spring Boot, building secure APIs with tools like JWT, Spring Security, Keycloak, and OAuth 2.0. I use MySQL and PostgreSQL for data storage, and deploy complete apps with Docker and AWS S3.

      <p className="text-white text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
        I'm also experienced with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and GitHub. While I focus on the back end, I can deliver full-stack solutions and manage Linux-based virtual machines for deployment and testing.
